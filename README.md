## Forest Weather Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict weather conditions in forests. This could be useful for forest management, fire prevention, and other applications.

The project will use a variety of data sources, including historical weather data, satellite imagery, and ground-based sensors. The data will be cleaned and preprocessed, and then used to train a machine learning model. The model will be evaluated on its ability to predict weather conditions on a held-out test set.

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it will be deployed to a production environment. This could involve integrating the model with a web service or mobile app.

### Requirements

* Python 3
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

### Installation

To install the required Python packages, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To train the machine learning model, run the following command:

```
python train_model.py
```

To predict weather conditions, run the following command:

```
python predict.py
```

### Example Output

The following is an example of the output of the `predict.py` script:

```
Predicted weather conditions:
    Temperature: 25 degrees Celsius
    Humidity: 75%
    Precipitation: 10%
    Wind speed: 5 m/s
```
